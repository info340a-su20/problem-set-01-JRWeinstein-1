    <h2>How K.K. Slider Relates to a Postmodern Audience</h2>
    <p>K.K. Slider is a renowned, almost mythical artist in the <a href="https://animal-crossing.com">Animal Crossing</a> franchise who serves as the games' hidden protagonist.
        As the underlying theme of the game is the deconstruction of the death of the soul and how capitalism commodifies community and expression, most notably through Tom Nook's mortgage program, K.K. Slider serves as the foil and champion for a primitivist perspective that promotes self-actualization and creativity for no sake except for its innate value.
        He is also a dog.
